# AppleClone_project


The goal of the project was to make a clone of an old version of the Apple website webpage (2014).

> This project helped me master the concepts of using images as a background and adding gradients to elements.
> I learned to size and position the page using correct semantic HTML elements appropriately.
> Correctly setting up the navigation bar.
